;;; Commentary:

;; This module provides functions to read the Windows registry, by
;; parsing the output of the reg.exe command-line tool and formatting it
;; into something a lisp program can understand.

;; Also, there are convenience functions to read well-known registry
;; values. Well, there's one anyway.

;; - `w32reg-get-ie-proxy-config' is suitable for setting
;;   url-proxy-services, which is used by the `url.el' package.

;; I will add more of these convenience functions later.
